## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this project, I devoted my time to create the webpage with HTML and CSS. I focused on using relative units to centre divs or other positioning works rather than using absolute units entirely as I used to do earlier. This has made the webpage more efficient and  responsive.
